Python-based Laboratory Work on Mathematical Analysis

This repository contains a completed laboratory assignment on Mathematical Analysis, implemented in Python. The assignment focuses on solving various problems using Python's programming capabilities.

Topics covered in this project include:

- Plotting functions using Sympy.
- Solving nonlinear equations using Sympy's `solve` and `solveset` functions.
- Numerical solution of nonlinear equations using `nsolve`.
- Differentiation: differentiating functions, including those defined parametrically.
- Function analysis: plotting graphs using `matplotlib.pyplot`.
- Function analysis using `sympy.calculus.util` and `sympy.calculus.singularities`.

The project also includes helpful links and resources to assist in completing the assigned tasks. [Optional: Add a link to the resources here]
